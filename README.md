# *Personal* Powershell Configuration
After writing and rewriting what amounted to essentially the same code every time I changed laptops, I decided to set up a dotfile-esque repository for my personal Powershell set-up and configuration files. This is a personal project and not intended for reuse by anyone but me, so it very much contains opinionated and likely terrible code that is fit for my eyes only. But it's also public and on the internet so _hey_! It also likely contains **not-generic** paths and config since it has only ever been tested on my current laptop. While I try my best to `Resolve-Path` and test paths, directories, and files that are used, I'm also not stressing about making it overly generic until I actually have to use it on another system, at which point it will become very clear exactly which items I missed and can easily correct them. <ins>Huzzah!</ins>
